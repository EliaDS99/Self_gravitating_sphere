# Self gravitating sphere solver

Project Status: Completed (Academic Project)
Development Period: March 2022 – April 2022
Language: C

## Description
This is a standalone C implementation of a numerical solver for the ODE of equilibrium of a self gravitating sphere with additional conditions linked to the teory of stars. It models the physics of equilibrium using the Runge-Kutta 4th order method.

## How to use
The code is contained in a single file for ease of use.
Compile with any standard C compiler:
$ gcc agata.c -o agata.x -lm
